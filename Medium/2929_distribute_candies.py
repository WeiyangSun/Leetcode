2929. Distribute Candies Among Children II

You are given two positive integers n and limit.

Return the total number of ways to distribute n candies among 3 children such
that no child gets more than limit candies.
"""

"""
Example 1:
Input: n = 5, limit = 2
Output: 3

Explanation: There are 3 ways to distribute 5 candies such that no child gets more than 
2 candies: (1, 2, 2), (2, 1, 2) and (2, 2, 1).

Example 2:
Input: n = 3, limit = 3
Output: 10

Explanation: There are 10 ways to distribute 3 candies such that no child gets more than
3 candies: (0, 0, 3), (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 1), (0, 3, 0), (1, 0, 2), (1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 0),
(2, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0) and (3, 0, 0).
