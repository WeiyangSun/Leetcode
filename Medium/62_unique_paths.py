62. Unique Paths

There is a robot on an mxn grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e. grid[0][0]).
The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m-1][n-1]). The robot can only move
either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to
reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2*10^9.

"""
Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28

Example 2:
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
