621. Task Scheduler

You are given an array of CPU tasks, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number n.
Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in
any order, but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap of at least n intervals between
two tasks with the same label.

Return the minimum number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks.
"""

"""
Example 1:
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again.
The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done,
so you idle. By the 4th interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

Example 2:
Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
Output: 6

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.
With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.

Example 3:
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3
Output: 10

Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.
There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals.
This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.
