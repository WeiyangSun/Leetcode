56. Merge Intervals

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start, end], merge all overlapping intervals, and
return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
"""

"""
Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]

Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
